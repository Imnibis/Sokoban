# Sokoban

 This is a 4-level sokoban-like game created in Unity 2022.1.23f1
 
 ## Thought process
 
 I chose minimalist graphics for several reasons:
 - I'm not good at finding assets online
 - I it easier to make it look decent
 - I just like it
 
 Controls-wise, at first, you needed to swipe for each square the character would move, which was really tedious.
 I changed it to a virtual stick which feels way better.

 Overall I always tried to add little animations and/or particle effects to make sure this tiny game feels as polished as possible.
